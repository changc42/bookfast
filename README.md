> Inspiration My brother has dyslexia, and I love reading. He would always want to know what my book was about. I thought about how there are people with dyslexia who would have a very difficult time enjoying books, so we thought of BookFast.

### üè† [Homepage](Challenges we ran into There were some parts of the project we thought would be easy to implement and fly through, as we have done them on previous projects. However, we underestimated the complexity of some of these areas such as authentication, React router caveats, and converting class complements to functional components.)

### ‚ú® [Demo](What's next for bookfast We plan to implement some of the unfinished features and refactor some of the sloppy, rushed code.)

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run start
